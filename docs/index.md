# Beyond the Living Fibers
Welcome to my website, where I share my findings and insights as a PhD researcher in aerospace engineering at TU Delft. I'm passionate about living composites, a field that explores the use of living organisms to create innovative and sustainable materials for a better future.  Whether you're a fellow researcher, a student, or simply curious about the future of materials science, I hope you find something of interest here.
