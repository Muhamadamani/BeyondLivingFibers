# Beyond the Living Fibers
Welcome to my digital garden 👋🏼, a space where I cultivate and share my knowledge as a PhD researcher in aerospace engineering at TU Delft. Here, I explore the fascinating world of living composites, as well as other topics that I'm passionate about, such as sustainability, innovation, and technology. Just like a real garden, the content here is constantly evolving and growing, with some ideas blooming beautifully and others needing more attention.
